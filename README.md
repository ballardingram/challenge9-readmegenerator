# Professional README Generator
This code is developed using starter code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma.git through my UT Bootcamp Full Stack program.

## Built With
This application was built with starter code from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma.git through my UT Bootcamp Full Stack program. The code was then updated with NODE, Inquirer, FS, and UTIL for functionality.

## How to Run the Code
Once the software is downloaded install Node, Inquirer, and UTIL. Then, in the command line type 'node index.js' to run the application.

## Contributions
This was largely an independent project that relied heavily on documentation, trial and error, and the challenge documentation. I referenced the challenge for similar functions.

## Observations
I am starting to understand how NODE and JS work together with certain call functions.

## Challenges
The licenses and references present an opportunity for me. There is probably something very simple I am not doing to have that a part of the final product, but it is not clicking as to what that is.
